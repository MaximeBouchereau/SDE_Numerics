Numerical resolutions of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE's) by using two methods:

- Forward Euler method ($L 2$-error: order $1/2$)
- Milstein method ($L 2$-error: order $1$)

Functions of the code enable:

- Plot approximated solutions with previous numerical schemes
- Plot convergence curve for $L 2$-error.
